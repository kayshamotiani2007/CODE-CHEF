# Sqrt(x)

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return  *the square root of* `x` *rounded down to the nearest integer*. The returned integer should be  **non-negative**  as well.

You  **must not use**  any built-in exponent function or operator.

- For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= x <= 231 - 1

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x < 2) return x; // Base cases: 0 -> 0, 1 -> 1
        
        int left = 1, right = x / 2;
        int ans = 0;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            // Equivalent to mid * mid <= x, avoiding 32-bit integer overflow
            if (mid <= x / mid) {
                ans = mid;     // mid is a valid candidate
                left = mid + 1; // try finding a larger integer
            } else {
                right = mid - 1; // mid * mid > x, search left half
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
        
    }
};
```
